		<h1>WHO WE ARE</h1>

		<section id="homemain">
			<article>
				<p id="intro">Amnesty International is a global movement of more than 7 million people who take injustice personally. We are campaigning for a world where human rights are enjoyed by all.</p>
				<p class="main">We are funded by members and people like you. We are independent of any political ideology, economic interest or religion. No government is beyond scrutiny. No situation is beyond hope. </p>
				<p class="main">Few would have predicted when we started that torturers would become international outlaws. That most countries would abolish the death penalty. And seemingly untouchable dictators would be made to answer for their crimes. </p>
